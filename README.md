## Description

Putting together all skills learnt thus far, I had to build from scratch a webpage that not only functions, but is accessible for multiple device types and is accessible to as many people as possible, including those who utilise screen readers or search websites via their keyboard.

This was a surprisingly challenging endevour, especially as I chose to abandon my initial attempt after I went too far down the rabbit hole of adding features and simply getting out of my skill depth. 
However for all the challenge, it was even more rewarding and putting this page together, even if it is doublt simple and basic to anyone possessing any kind of skill or knowledge has taught me a great deal.

I think it is very important to note that the lack of git commits is because I abandoned my first attempt and had to push to get this project complete in one day.
I'll attach a link to the abandoned project to show a more consistant level of git commits, but please do not mark me against the abandoned abomination. 
Truly is it hideous. And broken. So very broken.

## Installation

NA. Just view and enjoy the page.

## Usage

Here is a screenshot of the page.
Links at the top of the page are functioning, the contact me buttons only display a little message as I haven't learnt about cyber security to be confident posting my personal details over the internet.

One issue that I didn't notice until now, 30 minutes before submission is that the page, while functioning, looks quite stretched on my, admittedly large and rather wide monitor.
